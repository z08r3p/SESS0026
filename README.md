Summative Assessment Questions
1.       Competition   Policy.   When   the Single   Market programme   was launched,   European   leaders   believed   that it   would improve   the competitiveness of European   firms,   thus   facilitating   the emergence of   industrial champions.   Explain   the logic behind   this assertion   and assess   its   empirical   validity.   What   are   the   factors   that maybe hindering EU   firms’ competitiveness?
•      This   question   refers to   Lecture   5   (although   not exclusively)   and   requires some   research.
•       It   asks you to clarify the   mechanisms whereby the   SM   was   expected   to   provide   a   fertile   environment for firms to grow   and compete   globally.   In   doing   so,   you   must   employ the   appropriate theoretical framework(s).
•      You should then   assess whether the   model’s   prescriptions   have   realised. You   can   look   at   one   sector, one firm,   or several   ones, to   develop your   case.   External   resources   are   needed   here.
•       Finally, you   need to   examine the   limitations   of these   predictions.   In this   part, you   should think   widely   and   critically   about the factors   and circumstances that   have   reduced the SM
competitive gains,   by   referring to   other topics   studied   in this course.
2.       Capital   mobility.   One of the   Four Freedoms   established   by   the Single   European   Market   –   and
advanced at later stages - is capital   mobility.   Examine   the pros   and   cons   that   free   cross-country   capital   flows have brought about in   the   EU and   assess   the   current state   of   art   based   on   your   analysis   of   both   the   theory and EU   policies.
•      This   question   refers to   Lecture 4 and 8,   but   not   exclusively.
•       It   requires you to define the   rationale   and   policies that   have favoured   capital   mobility,   and   to      employ the   appropriate theoretical framework(s) to   analyse   its   political economy   implications   in the   EU.
•      You   can   adopt a   historical   perspective   or   use   key代 写SESS0026 Political Economy of European Integration 2023/24
代做程序编程语言   events to   elaborate   on the   benefits   and   shortfalls   of capital   market   integration   in the   EU.
•       Finally, you should   draw on the   latest   EU   institutional   developments – thus,   referring   to   other   topics   studied   in this course - to gauge   whether   they   are   effective   in   limiting   the   potential damage   of capital   mobility.
3.    Eurocrisis.   The sovereign debt crisis spread   only   within   the   Eurozone.   Explain   why   and   then   describe   how   European institutions have evolved   to protect the   euro.
•         This   question   relates to   Lecture   6   and 8,   but   not   exclusively.
•         Your   answer   must show   understanding of the   EMU’soriginalsin(s) – which   led to   external   imbalances   and   a sovereign   debt   crisis. You can –   but   need   not to   -   critically   compare the experiences   of   EMU   and   non-EMU   members   of the   EU to   develop your   argument.
•          Finally, you should   draw on the   latest   EU   institutional   developments   -   thus,   referring   to   other   topics   studied   in this course   - to gauge   whether   they   are   effective   in   protecting   the   single currency from future shocks.
4.    EU   Fiscal   Policy:   Develop the case   for   (or against)   a   fiscal   union.
•            This   question   is   mainly,   but   not   only,   based   on   Lecture   7.
•          Your   answer   should   problematise   fiscal   policymaking   in   the   context   of   European   integration,   with   its   pros   and   cons, to develop   an   informed   opinion   on the   best way forward   in the management   of   public finances.
•          You   can   analyse   the   evolution   of   this   policy   area,   in   light   of   past   challenges   and   opportunities for   change.   In   doing so, you   can touch   on   other   policy   areas   and draw   examples   from   different   countries.
•             Building   on   existing scholarship to form. your view   is   crucial.
•            Your   conclusions   need to   be   bold   as well   as   mindful   of their   own   limits.
